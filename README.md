Data for my PhD dissertation

## Verbs

  ### Matching English and Italian verbs
  Target and filler verbs in a single csv file
  ### Target verbs
  Two csv files for English and Italian, each verb is annotated with corpus frequency (ukWaC and itWaC) and Zipf score

## Corpus dObjs

  ### Raw nouns
  The full list of direct objects for each verb as extracted from ukWaC/itWaC (a separate file for each verb)
  ### Cleaned nouns
  The list of direct objects for each verb, cleaned as described in the thesis (a separate file for each verb)

## Behavioral PISA

  ### Stimuli 
  Files with verb-noun1-noun2 for English and Italian (actual stimuli are noun1-noun2, verb is reported here for the sake of completeness)
  ### Judgments
  Full judgments provided by 25 people (per language) on a 7-point Likert scale
  ### Scores
  Behavioral PISA scores computed with ad-hoc script in [other repository here](https://github.com/giuliacappelli/behavioralPISA)
  
## Predictors

  ### Semantic selectivity
  Resnik's SPS, Computational PISA, Behavioral PISA scores for English and Italian verbs (6 csv files)
  ### Telicity
  Telicity feature of English and Italian verbs, with scores for three telicity tests (2 csv files)
  ### Manner specification
  Manner specification feature of English and Italian verbs (2 csv files)
  
## Main experiment

  ### Stimuli
  Stimuli used in the behavioral experiments eliciting acceptability judgments about the implicit object construction in English and Italian (2 csv files)
  ### Judgments
  Full judgments provided by 30 people (per language) on a 7-point Likert scale for target sentences
  ### Errors
  Squared errors: distance between actual judgments and values predicted by the (full bPISA) model in English and Italian (2 csv files)
